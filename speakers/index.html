						<h2>Web: Platform or Pile 'O Hacks?</h2>
						<div>As we contemplate the quickly-approaching future of the
web-as-platform, much of the ground we're building on feels un-even.
Why do we have access to OpenGL, yet JavaScript doesn't have any
native way of talking about the binary data that underpins that
system? Why does &lt;canvas&gt; create a an imperative drawing surface which
is entirely un-integrated with the rest of HTML element drawing
lifecycle? This and many more deep mysteries lie at the boundary
between markup, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript...all under-pinned by the
same piles of C++. Where do we go from here? Is there hope of a
rational, coherent platform? How can we get there from here?</div>

						<h2>Learning to teach</h2>
						<div>Open web gives us a unique opportunity to learn about web technologies from the web itself. The source of every web page, stylesheet or script is only few clicks away, so it can easily become a learning material. I strongly believe that—as the builders of the web—we should care especially about those visitors of our web sites who want to learn something from our code. … And yes – the word ‘learn’ will occur many times in many forms during this talk.</div>

						<h2>What We Don't Know</h2>
						<div>On any given request for a website, there is precious little we know about the players involved. We don't know who the user is, where they live, what they speak, really anything about them. They are using a browser, but we don't know what that browser is. We don't know how they interact with that browser. That browser is on some device that we don't know about and we don't know how that device connects to to the internet. All we know is about the server where our website is hosted and the files we put there. We can make a better web by accommodating these unknowns.</div>

						<h2>Designing in the browser</h2>
						<div>Each website is a product used daily by people to take actions, not
just read the content on it. Your product is amorphous, it takes the
shape of whatever container it fills: a mobile browser, a touch
enabled desktop browser, or a 30" iMac that is connected to the
Internet via tethering. PhotoShop is just one of the means to an end
in this new age of utilitarian web sites.

The new technologies available in HTML5 already allow you to create
prototypes quickly in the browser. Learn how to create a prototype
from start to finish using these new technologies while taking
advantage of quick prototyping tools.</div>

						<h2>Mind the gap</h2>

Its combination with native graphic interfaces (WebGL, canvas) has offered a whole new playground for people using code as a creative tool. Meanwhile Javascript has stepped out the browser and has made its way to creative environments such as Openframeworks or Cinder, linking the power of desktop applications and the flexibility of scripting.
Through examples and initiatives, we will see how Javascript has become an important tool in the creative coding scene.</div>

						<h2>Alice.js: A Lightweight Independent CSS Engine</h2>
						<div>AliceJS is an open source micro javascript library (http://blackberry.github.com/Alice) that simplifies doing advanced animations with CSS. It’s self contained and works directly against the DOM to support a variety of use cases for web applications. With one line of JavaScript code, you can make almost any DOM elements swerve around the page while retaining a great amount of control with respect to animation parameters. Additionally, the framework introduced the concept of Organics, adding randomization characteristics to create visual effects that are subtly different each time they play out. Used for games as well as regular business apps, AliceJS can help bring freshness and polish to your work in a very simple and straightforward manner.</div>

						<h2>10 things I didn’t know about HTML</h2>
						<div>Web development never gets boring to me. Not just because nowadays,
new “HTML5” technologies are emerging like tubes of spaghetti at a
pasta factory — but mostly because *there’s always something new to
learn*. Even the oldest, most reliable features of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, “the
basics” that we take for granted every day, are full of hidden gems or
restrictions. During this talk, we’ll take a look at the more obscure parts of HTML,
CSS and JavaScript, and demystify some of them.</div>

						<h2>Pushing the boundaries without breaking&nbsp;the web</h2>
						<div>This is an exciting time for front-end development. The support of modern browsers for CSS3 and HTML5 is excellent and improving all the time. Before we get too excited about all the new shiny features we have to play with, we need to remember that in many ways the future of the open web is in our hands. We want to take advantage of new features. We need to push the boundaries of what is possible and what ought to be possible. However we need to do this without storing up problems for ourselves as web developers in the future, and without disadvantaging users who may be using older browsers through no fault of their own.</div>

						<h2>Patterns for organizing non-trivial JavaScript applications</h2>
						<div>In the bad old days of JavaScript, our days were spent fighting
through a thicket of DOM differences. These days, we've pretty much
conquered those challenges thanks to tools such as jQuery, but our new
challenge is figuring out how to adapt as more and more of our
application logic moves from the server to the client. We have great
tools like Backbone, Ember, Knockout, and more, but in order to use
them effectively, we need to do more than learn their APIs -- we need
to learn to think about our code beyond the DOM-centric ways of the
past. In this talk, I'll look at useful patterns for thinking about
client-side appplication development that will help you avoid creating
a tangled mess of code.</div>

						<h2>How browsers work internally</h2>
						<div>What exactly happens after you enter a URL, until you see the site content?
There is a well defined flow of actions that the browser does internally, like building the DOM
and render trees and painting. There is also a set of optimizations taken to ensure that the web site is presented quickly and smoothly.
The rendering of the web site is not a single action by the browser, but a set of small updates and constant reactions to interactions. Looking beneath the surface you'll be surprised by the amount of activity taking place in these milli seconds. Being aware of these internal actions can help us take better decisions in creating a more efficient and robust web sites.</div>

						<h2>Responsive Redesign: Smashing Magazine's Case-Study</h2>
						<div>You know it’s time to redesign when your design is becoming your own bottleneck — incapable of reflecting your changes, values and the new direction of your enterprise. If your list of necessary UX improvements is getting longer, yet you can’t meaningfuly integrate them in your current design, that’s a clear sign that something has to change. That’s exactly the issue Smashing Magazine's team faced before it decided to redesign Smashing Magazine back in July 2011.

In this talk Vitaly Friedman, the founder and editor-in-chief of Smashing Magazine, provides practical insights into the responsive redesign process and the decisions made (and rejected) during the process. Vitaly will share how the team transformed the new vision in the new design, explain technical difficulties and problems in the responsive design process as well as things to keep in mind when dealing with legacy content.</div>
